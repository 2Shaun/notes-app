**force** - $m\vec{a}$, $q\vec{E}$, measured in Newtons
- mass is analogous to charge and $a$ can be thought of as a vector field, just like $\vec{E}$

**energy** - the ability to do work

- when you hold an object up in the air, gravity has the ability to do work if let go. 

**work** - $mad$, measured in joules, "Newton meters", force over a distance

**electric current** - similar to volume flow rate, measured in amperes or coulombs/second (number of charged particles per second)

**power** - measured in watts, $\text{J/S}$: $E/t$, current*potential

**electric potential** - similar to pressure ($\text{J/m}^3$), measured in volts and $\text{J}/\text{C}$

- can't have amps without volts, can't have current without pressure

- you can move a test charge across an electric field to find the change in potential energy. you can then divide that value by the charge of the test charge to determine the **electric potential**
- when capacitor plates store electric charge, they store energy
- funny how mass bends space creating "gravitational" energy and charge creates electrical energy

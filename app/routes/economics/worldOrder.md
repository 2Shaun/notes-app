- economic history repeats itself
- paper money could be exchanged for gold during Nixon's presidency
  - paper money's value came from the gold
- when the U.S. ran out of gold, Nixon announced a "default" and broke its promise to exchange paper bills for gold
**devaluation** - currency is sometimes backed by exchange rate with another country's currency. happens when money is printed
**embargo** - ban on trade
- when money is printed, its value goes down, and people have more money to buy stocks, increasing their prices
**constitutions** - internal order for governing within one country
**treaty** - world order for governing between multiple countries
**reserve currency** - commonly accepted around the world
- conflict arises when rising powers are potentially going to replace the reserve currency
- education leads to technological innovation which leads to stronger military
- education must not only teach logic but character and respect for law
- a country's vital signs can be checked to predict its decline: corruption, education, resource allocation, openness to global thinking, character/determination, leadership capabilities
## rise
- successful new leaders must improve vital signs and find a good successor
- establish systems that work well
- converting, weakening, or eliminating others from opposition
**common purpose** - if an individual focuses on their own success, there is no common purpose for a team to work together to achieve
### trade routes
- allow you to collect the best resources in the world and the best knowledge in the world
- knowledge collection requires openness
- trade routes require military strength
- bonds are used to fund world trade, and traders return with profits
## top
- being the reserve currency allows countries to borrow more from citizens around the world
- the country then becomes the preferred storehold of wealth (borrowing excessively)
- spending power increases but so does debt
- wealth gaps continue to grow because rich people use their wealth to increase their own (funding politicians which preserve their systems and fund their children's education)
## decline
- happens when the leading power runs out of lenders
1. larger bond yields could reflect that a government is running out of lenders
2. money is printed when increasing bond yields cannot keep up with the debt
3. inflation leads to internal conflict arises, taxes on rich increase
4. when rich fear wealth will be taken away, they move it to other countries
5. when the rich move their wealth, government money received from taxes decreases and governments outlaw the buying of foreign countries
6. rich then begin to panic and productivity is undermined
7. internal conflict may escalate to a new peaceful constitution or violence (rich vs. poor) 
8. foreign powers recognize this conflict as weakness

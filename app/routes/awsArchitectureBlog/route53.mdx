[A Case Study in Global Fault Isolation](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/a-case-study-in-global-fault-isolation/)

- a stripe represents all nameservers in one TLD
  - ns-1.awsdns-1.com
  - ns-2.awsdns-1.com
  - ...

**hosted zone** - container for records, how to route traffic for a _specific domain_, e.g., example.com (and its subdomains acme.example.com, zenith.example.com, etc.)

- if the twitch.tv hosted zone had ns-584.awsdns-09.net (205.251.194.72), a twitch user could be sent to an edge location in Florida, Western Europe, or Japan (depending on anycast routing)
- each Route 53 edge location is responsible for serving the traffic for one or more stripes (but usually only one stripe)
- deployments are done in stripe (TLD) order, so if bad software is deployed causing an edge location to not respond, other edge locations will still work

**anycast routing** - generally brings the user to destination requiring lowest network latency

# comparison with Cloudflare

2shaun.productions uses Cloudflare as a nameserver, i.e., `hostname -t ns 2shaun.productions` returns:

- hassan.ns.cloudflare.com
- zelda.ns.cloudflare.com

twitch.tv likely uses Route53, i.e., `hostname -t ns twitch.tv` returns:

- ns-1450.awsdns-53.org
- ns-1778.awsdns-30.co.uk
- ns-219.awsdns-27.com
- ns-664.awsdns-19.net

  these 4 nameservers were chosen by shuffle sharding. this means that although `hostname -t ns netflix.com` may return ns-1450.awsdns-53.org, it is highly unlikely that it will overlap across all 4 TLDs (stripes)
  since edge locations typically only serve one stripe, it is less likely that twitch will have DNS issues as they can rely on .co.uk and .org edges

- charged particles receive potential energy when flowing through a battery, that potential energy is turned into light as they pass through the bulb
- batteries in parallel can be modeled as one battery with additive capacity
- charged particles with no voltage ($PE$) can be passing through a light builb, but it will not light it
  - this commonly occurs when a switch is opened like particles spread out
- batteries apply a force to charged particles, giving them voltage ($PE$) 
- when switches close, the two different parts of the circuit it connects equalize in voltage
- if both sides of a fountain pump water at the same pressure, current wont come out. same as if voltage is the same on both sides of a light bulb
- $\Delta V \propto I$
- imagine a fountain which preserves all water molecules in the pipe following the spurt. it makes sense that current would be preserved when the fountains are in series. does it make sense that pressure is preserved as it passes by one fountain that is in parallel?

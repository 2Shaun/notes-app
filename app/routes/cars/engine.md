## Piston
- there are rings on the pistons to keep oil under the combustion tank, but still keeping the cylinder lubricated
### 2 stroke cycle
1. **combustion**
- when gas is being compressed in the combustion chamber, the piston is up exposing the reed valve, allowing the air-gas mixture to flow into the crank case
2. **compression**
- when exhaust is being released, the piston is down compressing the air-gas mixture in the crank case and forcing it to flow into the combustion chamber
### 4 stroke cycle
1. **intake** 
- the piston sucks in air/fuel (gas+air) mixture into the cylinders via the intake port. the intake valves open the intake port
- valve stem seal prevent oil from leaking into the valve
- gas and air is mixed in the intake manifold when fuel is sprayed in
2. **compression** 
- by increasing density in the air/fuel mixture, the spark plug (in the cylinder head) can deliver more energy in the explosion. 
- ideally the air/fuel mixture is balanced to not have any fuel or oxygen left over
3. **power stroke** - power is transferred from the explosion to the crank shaft via the connecting rod
4. **exhaust** 
- removing the *hot* mixture (carbon dioxide+water) from the cylinders via the exhaust port by opening the exhaust valve
- much of the heat moves in the direction of the exhaust port, however, heat is absorbed by the engine block (which create the cylinder void)
### Crank shaft
- rpm is the rotations of the crank shaft per minute
- have counter weights which aid in raising the pistons
- located at the bottom of the pistons
- rotates the oil pump via chain
### Camshaft
- located at the top of the pistons. the camshaft opens valves by applying potential energy to a spring periodically
### Timing belt
- rotate the cam & crank shafts as to deliver steady power in a round robin type of stroke cycle.

## Gas Tank
- gas can evaporate here, the evaporative emissions system can utilize this evaporated gas

## Air flow to engine cylinder
1. air filter
2. throttle body
3. intake manifold to be sprayed with gas by the fuel injectors which deliver fuel from the fuel rail 
4. out of intake manifold when valve is opened

## Oil flow
1. oil pan (sump)
2. oil filter
3. oil cooler
4. oil galleries
# Engine Cooling
## Oil
- oil has a viscosity (weight)
- used to lubricate the cylinder but also carry heat away from moving parts
## Antifreeze

# gas
## octane rating
- which mixture of octane and heptane gives equivalent performance
- the octane rating represents an equivalent fuel of that octane percentage (and heptane percentage) that can withstand equivalent compression without exploding
- the more octane, the more likely it needs a spark plug
- 98 octane is very hard to explode under compression
- 20 octane (diesel) is pretty easy to make explode
- diesel engines do not have spark plugs, diesel fuel would cause much engine knocking in a car with a spark plug

## decoys
- when people can't compare something to another, they feel lost
- the first breadmaker didn't sell until a bigger and more expensive "decoy" was put on the market
- people generally pick the "medium" product when spending money
  - advertisers are aware of this phenomenon
- men compare income with wife's sister's husband (and women?)
- people may invite a slightly less attractive person to a party to act as a decoy

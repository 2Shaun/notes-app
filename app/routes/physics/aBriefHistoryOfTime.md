# Space and Time

- imagine Earth surface as a 2D place with the time axis going up as the 3rd dimension
- an event cone can be described as the ripples emitting from a stone hitting water, the ripples being graphed vertically as time passes
  - the outermost ripple (surface of the cone) is reserved for light, the insides of the cone are reserved for non-light phenomena (massive bodies)
- consider an event $P$ and two sets, the past events which could lead to $P$ and the future events which could happen as a result of $P$
- in the big bang model, events (space, time) prior to the big bang do not matter and may not even make sense
- no event on Earth could be effected by the sun dying atleast until the light from the event has reached Earth (roughly 8 minutes)
- the James Webb Telescope could not physically see the Big Bang occur since the light emitted from the event has long passed its position
- no matter what speed you are traveling, light is always observed at the same speed
  - this is contrary to other measurements, for example measuring a ping pong ball on the tracks of a moving train vs measuring it on the train itself
- the constant speed of light led scientists to believe in a fixed "ether" which light travels
- the "ether" idea was abandoned when Einstein presented a model (which agreed with many experiments) in which time was relative to the speed of the observer (no **absolute time**)
- as light curves around the sun, it would be possible to observe an object as if it were in the line of sight directly to the right of the sun, even though it may be truly to the left
  - this experiment had to be done during an eclipse as the light emitted from the sun would obscure such an object
- the idea of infinite stars was argued against by saying that light would theoretically be emitted from all directions, making all line of sights in the night sky brighter than the sun itself

# Expanding Universe

- temperature and chemical makeup of a star can be analyzed using spectroscopy
- light waves with a lower frequency are generally red
- all galaxies observed had some red-shifted spectra
- the doppler effect and the red-shifts of all galaxies are evidence for the ballooning universe, i.e., all galaxies are getting further and further apart
- microwaves (lower frequency than red-shifted light) were detected at Bell labs which are suspected to be extremely fast objects moving far far at the other end of the universe
- using relativity and the mass of the observable universe, Hawking showed that singularities are possible and that the big crunch will not happen (more mass is needed)
- the big bang describes a point where the universe had infinite curvature (singularity)
- the collapsing of stars to black holes represents another singularity
- general relativity is considered an incomplete description of the universe, in disagreements with quantum mechanics

# Uncertainty Principle

- prior to Heisenberg's experiment, many believed the world was deterministic
- in order to accurately measure the velocity of a particle, you need longer wave lengths
